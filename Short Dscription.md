This project focuses on the design and development of a PVC pipe-based hydroponic system. PVC, a versatile and widely used plastic, is utilized in both rigid and flexible forms for different components of the system. The setup involves drilling holes in PVC pipes to accommodate pots for plant roots to receive nutrient water. The system incorporates a motor connected to a water-filled tank, supplying water through the pipes. Nylon cable ties are used to secure the pipes in place and prevent overflow. The system allows for the cultivation of crops in a compact space and facilitates the continuous growth of crops by harvesting them above the root level.

Advantages of Hydroponics:

Efficient use of space: Hydroponic systems enable the cultivation of crops in smaller areas compared to traditional soil-based methods, making it ideal for urban and indoor farming.
Water conservation: Hydroponics uses significantly less water compared to traditional soil irrigation systems, as water is recirculated within the closed system.
Nutrient control: Hydroponic systems allow precise control over nutrient composition, ensuring optimal plant growth and maximizing yield.
Year-round cultivation: With hydroponics, crops can be grown year-round regardless of seasonal limitations, providing a consistent supply of fresh produce.
Pest and disease control: Hydroponic setups minimize the risk of soil-borne pests and diseases, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.
Disadvantages of Hydroponics:

Initial setup cost: Setting up a hydroponic system can involve higher initial costs compared to traditional soil-based farming due to the need for equipment, lighting, and nutrient solutions.
Technical knowledge requirement: Hydroponics requires a certain level of understanding and expertise in system setup, nutrient management, and environmental control.
Power dependency: Hydroponic systems often rely on electricity to operate pumps, lighting, and environmental control systems, making them vulnerable to power outages.
Monitoring and maintenance: Regular monitoring and maintenance are necessary to ensure the proper functioning of hydroponic systems, including pH and nutrient level adjustments.
System failure risks: Any malfunction in the system, such as pump failure or nutrient imbalance, can have a significant impact on plant health and crop yield.
